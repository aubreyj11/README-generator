## Description
 The purpose for this application is to allow a developer to quickly and easily create a README.md file for their project using the CLI. My motivation for this application was knowing that creating a README file can be tedious sometimes, and it must be extra tedious for developers who are working on complex code, so I wanted to make an easy way for them to create that file. I learned that using Node, Inquirer, and fs library is a big help when creating a project like this.
 
    
## Installation
 To install this application, clone the repository code and install both node and inquirer onto your local machine.
    
    
## Usage
 To use this application, open the integrated terminal for the index.js file and run the command ‘node index.js’ to be prompted with questions that, once you answer them, will create the README.

## Contributing
 If you would like to contribute to this project, simply clone the code and make it your own!
    
    
## Tests
 To test that this application is running correctly, run ‘node index.js’ in the terminal. If after all questions are answered you are returned a “Success!” then that means the application worked and the README file has been generated.
